## Coding Best Practices

- **Do not modify code or UI elements that already work**, unless explicitly instructed.
- Avoid duplicating existing functionality; reuse working components whenever possible.
- Write comprehensive tests for all new or modified functionality.
- **Never unintentionally delete data or code**; confirm explicitly before destructive actions.
- Commit frequently to maintain a reliable project history.
- Always ask clarifying questions if tasks or requirements are unclear.

## User Interface (UI)

- **Never change or affect the UI unintentionally.** Only alter UI components if explicitly instructed or clearly part of the assigned task.
- Always ensure UI changes are fully tested and validated.
